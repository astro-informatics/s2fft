Differentiable and accelerated spherical transforms with JAX
=================================================================================================================

`S2FFT` is a JAX package for computing Fourier transforms on the sphere
and rotation group. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable
transforms, which are also deployable on hardware accelerators
(e.g. GPUs and TPUs).

More specifically, `S2FFT` provides support for spin spherical harmonic
and Wigner transforms (for both real and complex signals), with support
for adjoint transformations where needed, and comes with different
optimisations (precompute or not) that one may select depending on
available resources and desired angular resolution $L$.
