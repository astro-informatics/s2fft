    Register a new custom JAX primitive.

    This function provides a streamlined way to register custom JAX primitives,
    including their implementation, abstract evaluation, lowering rules for different
    platforms, and optional rules for batching and automatic differentiation.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the primitive.
        multiple_results (bool): A boolean indicating whether the primitive returns multiple values.
        abstract_evaluation (Callable): A callable that defines the abstract evaluation rule for the primitive.
            It should take `ShapedArray` instances as inputs and return `ShapedArray` instances for the outputs.
        lowering_per_platform (Dict[Union[None, str], Callable]): A dictionary mapping platform names
            (e.g., "cpu", "gpu", or None for platform-independent) to their respective lowering rules.
            A lowering rule translates the primitive into a sequence of MLIR operations.
        batcher (Optional[Callable]): An optional callable that defines the batched evaluation rule for the primitive.
            This is used by JAX's automatic batching (vmap).
        jacobian_vector_product (Optional[Callable]): An optional callable that defines the Jacobian-vector product
            (JVP) rule for the primitive. This is used for forward-mode automatic differentiation.
        transpose (Optional[Callable]): An optional callable that defines the transpose rule for the primitive.
            This is used for reverse-mode automatic differentiation (autograd).
        is_linear (bool): A boolean indicating whether the primitive is linear. If True and a `transpose` rule
            is provided, `ad.deflinear` is used, which can optimize linear operations.

    Returns:
        jax.core.Primitive: The registered custom JAX primitive object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an invalid platform is specified in `lowering_per_platform`.

    # This means that by default, the primitive will be lowered to XLA.
